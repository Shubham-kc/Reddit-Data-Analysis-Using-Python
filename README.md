# Reddit-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This post is the first of a 4-part tutorial on extracting and analysing data from reddit. It is aimed at people completely new to working with JSON data. The parts are: 1. Setting up the environment. This weekâ€™s post will explain how to set up your environment with all the required packages in a way that lends itself to completely reproducible research. 2. Extracting the data. Next week, I will cover how to pull JSON-encoded data from reddit (using /r/relationships as my example) and put in into a pandas DataFrame for analysis. 3. Cleaning and describing the data. In two weeks I will demonstrate some data cleaning and basic descriptives in pandas. 4. Analysing the data. I will end in three weeks by setting up some basic hypotheses and testing them using pandas and scipy and showing some plotting in matplotlib.
